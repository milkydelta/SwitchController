It can be inferred that stick clicks are on 10 and 11, I dont know in what order, though.

Joystick Stuff

Analog values from -127 to 127

Remember to call Joystick.sendState();


Data Transmission stuff

14 total buttons - two bytes neee for that
Hat(dpad) is one of 9 states (-1 to 7)-  0.5 bytes needed
Each axis is from -127 to 128. A single byte signed integer for each.
2+0.5+(1*4)=6.5  7bytes of data is nescessary for the ful state of the controller.
