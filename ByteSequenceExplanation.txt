Byte 0 contains the states of the first 7 buttons (0 to 6). The most-significant (leftmost) bit is ignored

Byte 1 contains the states of the last 7 buttons (7 to 13). The most-significant (leftmost) bit is ignored

Within the bytes, the buttons are ordered least significant bit to most significant bit.

Each numbered button serves the following function. (I think. I havent checked in a while)

Y - 0
B - 1
A - 2
X - 3
L - 4
R - 5
ZL - 6

ZR - 7
- - 8
+ - 9
LS Click - 10
RS Click - 11
Home - 12
Capture - 13


Byte 2 contains the state of the hat (dpad). This is a signed integer.
-1 is no directions pressed and 0 to 7 are the directions of an 8-way dpad
It increases by one for every 45 degrees clockwise with 0 representing North.


Byte 3 is the Left X axis as a signed integer

Byte 4 is the Left Y axis as a signed integer

Byte 5 is the Right X axis as a signed integer

Byte 6 is the Right Y axis as a signed integer



I got this info by reading the uncommented arduino sketch, so I may have labelled these incorrectly.
Thankfully, I have learned from my previous self and will try to comment any future projects thoroughly.
